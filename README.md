# Biased Tweets Visualizer

Jupyter Notebook files or IPython Notebook files with an .ipynb extension will be rendered as static HTML files. 
This means that when you open the source file in this directory, you will not be able to view interactive features such as custom JS plots in this repo

To view the notebook with JavaScript content rendered or to share this file with others, you can use [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/)

[Use this link](https://nbviewer.org/github/donchuru/BiasedTweets/blob/main/Biased_Content_Map.ipynb) to view the Biased Content Map notebook with the interactive features rendered
